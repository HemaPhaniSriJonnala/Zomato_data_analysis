Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato using Python and various data analysis libraries. The objective is to explore key factors such as restaurant types, ratings, online ordering, and customer preferences. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and insights generation to answer questions about restaurant preferences, cost range, and more.

Libraries Used
Numpy: Used for efficient numerical computations and handling large datasets.
Matplotlib: Used for creating high-quality plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
Pandas: Used to load and manipulate data in DataFrames.
Seaborn: Provides a high-level interface for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
You can use either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run this analysis for an easy experience.

This project analyzes the Zomato dataset to answer the following questions:

Do more restaurants provide online delivery or offline services?
Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

This analysis provides actionable insights into the restaurant industry, helping businesses make data-driven decisions about their operations, pricing, and services. For example:

Online orders tend to get higher ratings than offline orders.
Most customers prefer dining at restaurants with a moderate cost range.
